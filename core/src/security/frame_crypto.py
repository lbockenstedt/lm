"""App-layer AEAD encryption of secret-bearing Hub↔spoke frames (H4).

The spoke↔hub wire frame is ``<sig>.<body>`` where the body is compact JSON
HMAC-signed for **integrity** but **never encrypted**. On a plaintext
``ws://`` loopback link (co-located spokes, or an advertise-TLS proxy→hub hop)
a co-located sniffer reads secret fields in cleartext: the session secret in
``SPOKE_UPDATE_SESSION_KEY``, cert private keys, the hub root secret, and
credentials in config pushes. The HMAC protects integrity, not
confidentiality — this module adds confidentiality on top of the existing
HMAC, without touching the signing path.

**Key reuse, don't build new key material:** the AEAD key is derived from the
*same secret that already HMAC-signs the frame* (HKDF-SHA256 → AES-256-GCM,
info ``b"lm-app-layer-enc-v1"``, 32 bytes). Both sides always have it — no new
key exchange, no new crypto lifecycle. ``cryptography>=42`` is already a dep;
``AESGCM``/``HKDF`` are simply unused until now (``Fernet``/``PBKDF2HMAC`` were
the only imported primitives).

**Wire form when encrypted:**
``payload = {"type": <type>, "data": "<base64(nonce||ct||tag)>", "enc": "v1"}``
Non-``data`` payload keys (e.g. ``correlation_id`` on reply frames) are
preserved. The receiver: if ``payload["enc"] == "v1"`` → ``data`` is a b64
string → decrypt → restore ``data`` to the plaintext dict, drop ``enc``. The
marker's presence/absence drives behavior — no per-type branching on the
receive side. ``wrap``/``unwrap`` are in-place and idempotent on the payload
dict so callers can operate on the live frame object.

**Fail-safe + no fleet break:** the ``enc:"v1"`` marker is purely additive;
every version combo degrades to today's plaintext (mixed → plaintext, legacy
unchanged). ``LM_APP_ENCRYPTION=0`` makes a new hub/spoke behave as legacy
(don't advertise, don't encrypt) — operator rollback without redeploy. This
module is intentionally stateless — it holds no secrets; the secret is
supplied per call by the hub (:mod:`security.key_manager`) or the spoke
(``self.secret``).
