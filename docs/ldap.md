# ldap — Directory

LDAP directory spoke. Repo: `ldap`. `module_type = "directory"`. See [architecture-topology.md](architecture-topology.md).

## Role & module_type

Directory spoke for an OpenLDAP/389-DS-style server (install targets `slapd`; `ldap_manager.py` uses `python-ldap`). OU/user/group CRUD, group membership, password set, rename (modrdn), and a unified user/computer search. Not a discovery source for IPAM.

## What it does

ldap manages a real LDAP directory server for the lab — organizational units, user accounts, groups, group membership, and passwords — from the WebUI's **Directory** view instead of `ldapsearch`/`ldapmodify` on the command line.

It also feeds the hub's global search bar: any user or computer entry in the directory shows up when you search from anywhere in the WebUI, tagged as an LDAP result.

It is not an IPAM/NetBox discovery source — it doesn't push devices, IPs, or hosts into NetBox; its only outward integration points are the global search feed and (optionally) being a TLS certificate install target for the Certificate Management module.

## Entrypoints

`python3 -m src.main` (`LdapControlPlane`); spoke `LdapSpoke(BaseSpoke)`. systemd `lm-ldap.service` (`After=network.target slapd.service`). Installer `install_ldap.sh` (pre-seeds slapd debconf `slapd/domain string lm.local`, backend MDB, installs `slapd ldap-utils python3-pip python3-venv git curl jq libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev`, `.env`, unit). `base_structure.ldif` is a **reference template** (People/Groups OUs + an example admin user) — it is **not** auto-applied by the installer; load it manually with `ldapadd -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// -f base_structure.ldif` (adjust the `dc=…` suffix to your real base DN first).

> **Primarily a role now.** LDAP runs mainly as the **`ldap`** role hosted by the generic agent (`agent-<hostname>`, unit `lm-agent`): the agent opens a sub-spoke `{agent}-ldap` (module_type `directory`, parent-auto-approved) and self-installs it via `agent/src/agent_spoke.py::_install_role` (clones `lbockenstedt/ldap.git` + deps). The dedicated `lm-ldap.service` / `install_ldap.sh` `ldap-spoke-1` path is the **legacy/standalone** alternative. Connection config (`LDAP_SERVER_URL`/admin DN/PW/base DN) comes from the hub push (WebUI), not a per-module `.env`.

## Ports / backends

Talks to the LDAP server via `python-ldap` (`ldap.initialize` + `simple_bind_s`), `src/ldap_manager.py`. Default `LDAP_SERVER_URL=ldap://localhost:389`. No port served.

## Environment variables

`SPOKE_ID`, `SPOKE_SECRET`, `HUB_SECRET`, `HUB_WS`, `HUB_API`, `LDAP_ADMIN_DN` (`cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org`), `LDAP_ADMIN_PW` (required; warned if empty), `LDAP_BASE_DN` (`dc=example,dc=org`), `LDAP_SERVER_URL` (`ldap://localhost:389`). Note: `.env.template` lacks `LDAP_SERVER_URL`; the installer writes it.

## Install flags

`install_ldap.sh`: `--hub`, `--id`/`--name`, `--secret`, `--hub-secret`, `--all-prereqs` (no-op). Only passes `--secret`/`--hub-secret` when non-empty (avoid argparse abort).

## Key commands / handlers (`ldap_spoke.handle_command`)

`GET_VERSION`, `UPDATE_CONFIG` (re-init `LdapManager`), `INSTALL_CERT` (hub-brokered Let's Encrypt cert install — writes leaf/key/CA under `/etc/ldap/tls`, points slapd `cn=config` `olcTLSCertificateFile`/`olcTLSCertificateKeyFile`/`olcTLSCACertificateFile` at them via `ldapmodify -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:///`, restarts `slapd`; root only), `LIST_OUS`, `CREATE_OU`, `UPDATE_OU` (modrdn rename), `LIST_USERS`, `CREATE_USER` (`inetOrgPerson`; `secrets.token_urlsafe(16)` random password if none, returned), `UPDATE_USER` (modify cn/sn/givenName/mail + optional uid rename), `LIST_GROUPS` (`groupOfNames` or `posixGroup`), `CREATE_GROUP` (`groupOfNames` requires ≥1 member → seeded with base DN), `UPDATE_GROUP` (cn modrdn), `ADD_USER_TO_GROUP`, `REMOVE_USER_FROM_GROUP`, `SET_PASSWORD` (`passwd_s` with `modify_s` userPassword fallback), `DELETE_ENTITY`, `SEARCH_USERS` (filter on uid/cn/mail/sn/givenName/dNSHostName, escapes `\*()`, tags `source="ldap"`, type `user`/`computer`).

## Key files

`src/main.py`, `src/ldap_spoke.py`, `src/ldap_manager.py` (~315 lines, whole `LdapManager`), `install_ldap.sh`, `base_structure.ldif`, `README.md`, `.env.template`, `requirements.txt`, `VERSION`.

## Notable behaviors & gotchas

- **Namespace-package loader (no `__init__.py`)** — `src/` has no `__init__.py`; works as a Python 3 namespace package. `main.py` runs as `-m src.main` and imports `from src.ldap_spoke import LdapSpoke`; `ldap_spoke.py` uses the **relative** import `from .ldap_manager import LdapManager`. `BaseSpoke` import uses the dual-path `try: from base_spoke import BaseSpoke except ImportError: from core.src.base_spoke import BaseSpoke`. Installer sets `PYTHONPATH=$INSTALL_DIR:$INSTALL_DIR/core/src:$INSTALL_DIR/ldap/src`.
- **`LdapControlPlane.register_module` is overridden locally** (assigns `self.modules[name]`) — minor duplication; the only one of this group that does this.
- **Password generation** — `create_user` never hardcodes a password (`secrets.token_urlsafe(16)` default; returns it).
- **`search`** is the cross-cutting directory query the hub uses for global search (returns `source="ldap"` records compatible with the hub's unified results).
- **Generic python-ldap** — works against any RFC-4511 server; nothing FreeIPA-specific. Install path targets OpenLDAP `slapd`; FreeIPA/389-DS work with the same `LDAP_ADMIN_DN`/`LDAP_BASE_DN`/`LDAP_SERVER_URL`.

## How it works

- **Hub connection.** Like every LM spoke, ldap dials the hub over a WebSocket. In the current unified model this is the sub-spoke `{agent}-ldap` opened by the generic agent (parent-auto-approved); the legacy path is the standalone `ldap-spoke-1` dialing the hub directly. Either way the wire protocol is identical.
- **Config delivery.** Connection settings — `LDAP_SERVER_URL`, `LDAP_ADMIN_DN`, `LDAP_ADMIN_PW`, `LDAP_BASE_DN` — are **not** read from a per-module `.env` when running as a role. The hub pushes them via `UPDATE_CONFIG`, normally right after you fill in the Directory setup form in the WebUI. On `UPDATE_CONFIG` the spoke discards its current config and rebuilds `LdapManager` from scratch with the new values, so a fixed typo (e.g. a wrong admin password) takes effect on the next push without restarting the process.
- **Command flow.** Every WebUI action (list/create/update/delete an OU, user, or group; add/remove group membership; reset a password; rename an entry) becomes one `LdapSpoke.handle_command` call, which runs the matching `LdapManager` method. Because `python-ldap` calls are synchronous/blocking, each one runs in a worker thread via `asyncio.to_thread` — this keeps the spoke's heartbeat to the hub alive even if the directory server is slow or unreachable. Without that, a stalled bind would freeze the spoke's event loop, queue every other command behind it, and get the spoke disconnected as unresponsive.
- **Connection hygiene.** `LdapManager._conn()` opens a fresh bind for each operation and always unbinds afterward, even on error. (An older code path bound once per call and never unbound, which could exhaust the directory server's connection limit on a long-running spoke.)
- **Global search integration.** `SEARCH_USERS` is the query the hub's cross-system search fans out to every connected directory spoke (alongside NetBox, DHCP, VM, and session searches). It matches on `uid`, `cn`, `mail`, `sn`, `givenName`, or `dNSHostName`, and returns each hit tagged `source="ldap"` with `type` `user` or `computer` (based on `objectClass`) so the WebUI can merge and label results consistently across modules.
- **Certificate installation.** The hub can push an `INSTALL_CERT` command to the ldap spoke — the same command it sends to firewall and hypervisor targets — when a certificate issued by the Certificate Management (le) module is targeted at this directory server. The spoke writes the leaf certificate and private key (plus any CA chain) under `/etc/ldap/tls`, points slapd's `cn=config` `olcTLSCertificateFile`/`olcTLSCertificateKeyFile`/`olcTLSCACertificateFile` at the new files via `ldapmodify -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:///`, and restarts `slapd` so the new TLS context takes effect. This only works when the ldap spoke runs on the OpenLDAP host itself as root (needed to restart the service and read the key file).

## How to use it

1. **Connect a directory.** In the Directory view, enter the LDAP server URL, base DN, admin DN, and admin password, and save. This is pushed to the spoke as `UPDATE_CONFIG`; a green/healthy status means the bind succeeded.
2. **Create an OU.** Give it a name (optionally under a parent OU/DN). It's created as an `organizationalUnit` entry.
3. **Create a user.** Provide first name, last name, username, email, and the OU to place them in. Leave the password field blank to have ldap generate a strong random one — it's returned once in the response, so copy it down or hand it to the user immediately; it is not shown again.
4. **Create a group.** Groups are `groupOfNames`, which requires at least one member to exist at all — ldap seeds a new group with the directory's base DN as a placeholder member so creation never fails; add real members afterward and remove the placeholder if you like.
5. **Add / remove a user from a group.** Pick the user and the group; this is a single membership add/remove, not a full group rewrite.
6. **Reset a password.** Set a new password for a user DN directly (no need to know the old one) — this uses LDAP's Password-Modify extended operation, falling back to a direct attribute replace if the server doesn't support it.
7. **Rename an entry.** Renaming an OU, user, or group changes its RDN (`modrdn`) — e.g. changing a username changes the `uid=` component of its DN, which is why the DN in the UI may change after a rename.

## Troubleshooting / common questions

- **"Connect fails / can't bind to the directory."** Double-check the server URL, admin DN, admin password, and base DN in the Directory setup form. An empty admin password is explicitly logged as a warning — the bind will fail with an authentication error until it's set.
- **"The Directory spoke shows offline/red."** The `ldap` role isn't installed on the agent, the agent process (`lm-agent`) is down, or the sub-spoke hasn't been approved yet. Confirm the role is active on the intended host.
- **"Creating a group fails."** `groupOfNames` entries require at least one `member` attribute — if creation still fails after that, check that the target OU exists and the admin account has write access there.
- **"Does this work with FreeIPA or 389-DS, not just OpenLDAP?"** Yes for directory operations — `python-ldap` speaks generic RFC-4511 LDAP, so any compliant server works once you point `LDAP_SERVER_URL`/`LDAP_ADMIN_DN`/`LDAP_BASE_DN` at it. The **installer** (`install_ldap.sh`) is OpenLDAP/`slapd`-specific; a FreeIPA/389-DS server is expected to already exist and just be pointed at.
- **"Why isn't there a config file I can edit for the connection settings?"** In the current agent+role model, config comes from the hub's `UPDATE_CONFIG` push (the WebUI form), not a per-module `.env` — this is deliberate so the hub is the single source of truth and a config change doesn't require touching the host.
- **"A user isn't showing up in the global search bar."** Confirm the Directory spoke is online, and that the search term matches one of the indexed fields (`uid`, `cn`, `mail`, `sn`, `givenName`, `dNSHostName`) — search does not match on arbitrary attributes like OU name or group membership.
