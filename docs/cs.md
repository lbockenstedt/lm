# cs — Client Simulation

Client Simulation spoke. Repo: `cs`. `module_type = "simulation"`, label "Agent"/"Client Simulator". See [architecture-topology.md](architecture-topology.md).

## Role & module_type

The active LM spoke is `lm-spoke/` (`CSSpoke`), **relay-only** for Proxmox/USB auto-provisioning (the gate/VMID audit runs in the pxmx agent). It owns: the sim engine, client registry, per-client override control panel, hub-config store, command queue, token store, demo scenarios, and the DHCP/client API for the isolated sim-client network. `webui-spoke/` is the **legacy/standalone** combined spoke+UI server (FastAPI :8000, Aruba Central, older relay) — a parallel path, not the LM-native active one. `clients/` holds sim-agent scripts that run on sim VMs (Linux/Windows/T3).

## What it does

Client Simulation drives a fleet of lightweight "fake client" VMs that pretend to be real end-user devices — they associate to Wi-Fi, pull DHCP, run DNS/ping/iperf/download/web traffic, and report health — so you can demo and exercise the lab (NAC, firewall, DHCP/DNS, monitoring) with realistic load and realistic failures without touching real hardware.

In the WebUI it is the left-nav **Simulations** page. From there you watch client health and hardware/Central checks (Dashboard, Clients, Central), see the Proxmox hosts and VMs that back the sim clients (VM Server), edit the traffic profiles (Config), and turn on/tune auto-provisioning and the isolated sim network (Setup → Proxmox, plus the hub-level Setup → Simulations tile for the DHCP-server card).

The cs spoke itself owns the simulation "profile" logic, the per-client override/demo controls, the isolated sim-client DHCP network, and the client-facing API the sim VMs phone home to. It does **not** create Proxmox VMs itself — that brain lives in the pxmx agent (see below).

## Entrypoints

- **lm-spoke (native):** `python3 -m src.control_plane` (`CSControlPlane`), systemd `lm-cs.service`, `User=svc_lm`, `--port $CS_API_PORT --host $CS_API_HOST`. Installer `lm-spoke/install_cs.sh` (clones lm core `core/` to `/opt/lm/core`, cs to `/opt/lm/cs`, a cs-OWNED Kea DHCP4 sim instance on the 2nd NIC, `lm-cs.service`, rollback watchdog + sudoers). `--standalone` opts out of hub mode.
- **webui-spoke (legacy):** `uvicorn server:app` :8000. Installer `installers/install-lxc.sh`.
- **Sim agents:** `clients/linux/agent.sh` (systemd `client-sim-agent.service`), `clients/windows/*.ps1`, `clients/t3/*`.

> **Primarily a role now.** cs runs mainly as the **`simulation`** role hosted by the agent (`agent-<hostname>`, unit `lm-agent`): the agent opens a sub-spoke `{agent}-simulation` (module_type `simulation`, parent-auto-approved) and self-installs the role via `agent/src/agent_spoke.py::_install_role` — cloning `lbockenstedt/cs.git` + deps and running `install_cs.sh --infra-only` for the idempotent host prep (cs-owned Kea + 2nd-NIC). The dedicated `lm-cs.service` / `install_cs.sh` `{module}-spoke-1` path below is the **legacy/standalone** alternative. Sim/provisioning config arrives via the hub push (WebUI), not a per-module `.env`.

## Ports

- lm-spoke client API: `CS_API_PORT` (default **8080**, not 8000 — the legacy webui-spoke used :8000; the unified LM hub owns :443). Bound `0.0.0.0`/`CS_API_HOST` so it also lands on the DHCP NIC `169.253.1.1`. Clients reach `169.253.1.1:8080`.
- Spoke dials hub on **443** (`/ws/spoke`, wss — verify-off same-box).
- webui-spoke legacy: **8000** HTTP + WS `/ws`.
- DHCP: a **cs-owned Kea** DHCP4 instance on the auto-detected 2nd NIC (SEPARATE from the `dhcp` module's Kea, which is ctrl-agent :8001), static subnet `169.253.1.0/24`, pool `169.253.1.11`–`169.253.1.254`, no default gateway/router option. Configs `/etc/kea/kea-dhcp4-sim.conf` + `/etc/kea/kea-ctrl-agent-sim.conf`; ctrl-agent on **127.0.0.1:8002**; control socket `/run/kea/kea4-ctrl-socket-sim`; memfile leases `/var/lib/kea/kea-leases4-sim.csv`; units `kea-dhcp4-sim.service` + `kea-ctrl-agent-sim.service`.

## Environment variables

- `.env`: `HUB_URL`, `SPOKE_ID`, `SPOKE_SECRET`, `HUB_SECRET`, `CS_API_PORT`, `CS_API_HOST`, `LM_HUB_TLS_VERIFY`, `LM_HUB_CA_CERT`.
- Process: `LM_ONBOARDING_PSK`, `LM_TENANT_ID_HINT`, `CS_TELEMETRY_INTERVAL_S` (10), `LM_DEP_GUARD_DISABLE`.
- DHCP (installer): `DHCP_IFACE`, `DHCP_SUBNET`, `DHCP_PREFIX`, `DHCP_GATEWAY`, `DHCP_RANGE_START`, `DHCP_RANGE_END`, `DHCP_LEASE_TIME`, `DHCP_SKIP`.

## Install flags

`lm-spoke/install_cs.sh`: `--hub`, `--id`/`--name`, `--secret`, `--hub-secret`, `--dhcp-iface`, `--no-dhcp`, `--tls-verify` (+ `--tls-ca-cert`, **required**), `--admin-token` (deprecated no-op), `--all-prereqs` (no-op). A stale `CS_API_PORT=8000` is auto-migrated to 8080. `control_plane.py` CLI also accepts `--port`, `--host`, `--standalone`, `--onboarding-psk`, `--tenant-id-hint`.

## Notable behaviors & gotchas

- **lm-spoke is relay-only for Proxmox** — `proxmox_deploy.py` ingests telemetry + builds `relay_payload` (per-host `provision` diagnostic with `cs_enabled`/`loop_running`/`auto_provision_on`/`reason`/`halt`); the brain is `pxmx/agent/src/usb_provision.py`.
- **Client API port 8080** (was 8000) — at the time, the hub owned :8000 in hub mode; a second bind failed with `[Errno 98]` and crash-looped `lm-cs`. The hub has since moved to unified :443, but cs stays on 8080. Installer migrates stale `.env`.
- **Two flags trap** — tenant `usb_auto_provision` toggle ≠ per-agent `client_simulation.enabled`; the provision loop only spawns on the latter (the "enabled but nothing provisions" root cause).
- **store.set_hub_config REPLACES** — both `csSaveHubConfig` and `csSaveAutoProvConfig` must GET-merge-PUT or the two cards wipe each other.
- **CS_CONFIG_UPDATE handler** is required for hub config pushes (usb_vidpids, templates, sim/user overrides) to land — without it they silently dropped to "Unknown command" and `usb_vidpids` stayed `[]`.
- **Auto-provision config fans out to ALL bound cs spokes** — the hub's `get_client_sim_spokes` (plural) pushes the auto-provision toggle, hub-config save, and USB approval merge to *every* approved, connected cs spoke for the tenant (a tenant may bind several — cs-svr-02 / -03 / -04), concurrently — not just one (with a singular fallback for older hub builds).
- **Setup/Proxmox list fields are comma- or space-delimited** in the WebUI (USB certified/ignored VID:PIDs, T1/T3 PCI VID:PIDs, ignored hostnames); the hub normalizes them to a list (`normalize_hub_config_lists`, split on `[,\s]+`) before storing/pushing — no raw JSON to paste.
- **Sim-client Site/PHY/Sim-ID is SERVER-resolved** — the bash client's `/api/status` beacon OMITS `wsite` and `sim_phy` entirely and may carry a stale `simulation_id` (the old character-position hashing produced values like `sl`). The cs relay (`control_plane.py` `CS_TELEMETRY` build) calls `sim_config.effective_client_fields`, which re-resolves the authoritative `simulation_id` + `wsite` + `sim_phy` from the hostname's bucket profile (`resolve_profile`: `crc32(hostname) % 10` → `s0`–`s9` + per-`[username]` override) and injects them into the client payload sent to the hub. So the WebUI Clients view shows the server-resolved Site/PHY/Sim-ID, not whatever the bash client reported — the local dashboard (`local_ui_routes.py`) uses the same shared helper so the two never diverge.

## How it works

**End-to-end, cs is a control + relay plane; the pxmx agent is the execution plane.**

**Proxmox is relay-only here.** The cs lm-spoke never talks to Proxmox directly. The unified **pxmx agent** (running on each Proxmox host) is where the auto-provisioning *brain* lives (`pxmx/agent/src/usb_provision.py::run_provision_loop`). That loop decides when to clone, reboot, reclone, or delete sim VMs. cs only: (a) ingests the agent's telemetry (`CS_INGEST_TELEMETRY` etc.), (b) stores per-host Proxmox state + rolling CPU/mem 1h averages (`proxmox_deploy.py`), (c) re-emits a `CS_TELEMETRY` frame to the hub every ~10s so the VM Server view has data, and (d) surfaces a per-host **`provision` diagnostic** (`cs_enabled` / `loop_running` / `auto_provision_on` / `reason` / `halt`) that reports *why* the agent's loop is or isn't provisioning. Commands the UI issues (start/stop/reclone a VM, push USB/dongle config) are queued on cs and relayed to the agent by the hub's `CSBridgePoller`.

**The sim engine + config resolver.** `simulation_engine.py` + `sim_config.py` compute each client's effective profile. A client is deterministically bucketed into one of ten profiles `s0`–`s9` by `crc32(hostname) % 10`, then layered: `[simulation]` globals → `[address]`/`[server]` targets → the `[sX]` bucket → a per-`[username]` override (username = hostname before the first `-`, e.g. `jsmith-1` → `jsmith`). All of this is edited in **Simulations → Config → Simulation** (`simulation.conf`) and user-overrides. Hub-pushed overrides are merged from `hub-sim-overrides.conf` / `hub-user-overrides.conf` on top.

**Client registry + per-client overrides.** Every sim VM that reports in is tracked in `client_registry.py` (persisted to `data/clients.json`): last-seen, SSID, gateway reachability, running sims, recent errors. The **per-client Control Panel** (11 fault toggles) writes *persisted* overrides into that registry. **Demo scenarios** (`demo_scenarios.py`) are the ephemeral counterpart: an in-memory, 120-minute-TTL override that flips one failure flag and auto-expires (or clears on reboot) back to whatever the operator had set — demos never mutate the persisted registry.

**Hub-config store + command queue.** Auto-provisioning knobs (templates, VMID range, thresholds, dongle VID:PIDs) live in a local store (`local_store.py`) and/or arrive from the hub via `CS_CONFIG_UPDATE`. The command queue (`command_queue.py`) holds VM actions (`pending → delivered → completed/failed/expired`) with an idempotent enqueue and a sim-VMID safeguard (refuses anything below VMID 90000 or in `protected_vmids`, default `{1001}`) so the UI can only ever touch sim VMs.

**The cs-owned sim DHCP.** cs owns its **own** Kea DHCP4 instance for the isolated sim-client network — this is **separate** from the `dhcp` module's Kea. `install_cs.sh` provisions it on an auto-detected **second NIC** at `169.253.1.1`, static subnet **`169.253.1.0/24`**, pool **`169.253.1.11`–`169.253.1.254`**, **no** router/gateway option (the network is deliberately isolated). Configs: `/etc/kea/kea-dhcp4-sim.conf` + `/etc/kea/kea-ctrl-agent-sim.conf`; the sim control agent listens on **127.0.0.1:8002** (the `dhcp` module's Kea control agent is on a different port); leases in `/var/lib/kea/kea-leases4-sim.csv`; units `kea-dhcp4-sim.service` + `kea-ctrl-agent-sim.service`. `dhcp_status.py` cheaply reads the lease CSV (not the ctrl-agent) and rides the 10s telemetry frame to the hub's DHCP-server card.

**How a sim client gets an address and phones home.** A sim VM boots on the isolated sim network → the cs-owned Kea leases it an address from `169.253.1.11`–`.254` → the client reaches the **client API at `169.253.1.1:8080`** (`client_api.py`, FastAPI). It fetches its profile from `GET /api/config?hostname=…` (bucket + overrides + any live demo flags baked in), POSTs status beacons to `/api/status` (upserting the registry), and opens `ws /ws/client` for live command push. When a client-api key is set, the linux agent fetches it from `/api/client/key` first; the t3 agent sends none (empty key = open).

## Sim Quotas (alert-driven auto-fill)

**The idea.** A sim quota links a *monitored* Aruba Central alert or insight (Central → Alerts/Insights → Monitor) to the simulation that produces it, plus a run policy: *keep N online clients in a site running that sim*. Example: "DNS Fail = 10 in site MIA" → the engine grabs 10 online clients in MIA and runs the DNS-failure sim on them; if one dies/goes offline, a substitute is picked up; if the original comes back, the over-N trim releases the substitute. The INVERTED-semantics Central poller (`central_poller`) is HEALTHY when the error IS present; the quota engine is what keeps it reliably present.

**Two layers of config.** Platform-wide **defaults** live in Setup → Simulations (superadmin); a tenant **overrides** per alert in Config → Sim Quotas. The hub merges them (`sim_quota.merge_effective_quotas`): if a tenant declares ANY row for an alert (enabled or disabled), the tenant OWNS that alert — its rows win and the global default for that alert is suppressed (so a tenant can explicitly turn an alert OFF with a disabled row). Alerts the tenant hasn't touched inherit the global default. The merged enabled-only list is pushed to the cs spoke (`CS_CONFIG_UPDATE` → `set_effective_sim_quotas`) and the `SimQuotaEngine` reconciles against it.

**The engine** (`sim_quota_engine.py`) owns a persisted ledger (`sim_quota_ledger.json`) and a 60s reconcile loop (plus an immediate reconcile on every effective-quota push). Per sweep, per quota: keep ledger clients still online + in-site + running the sim; keep an offline client in the ledger (the sim keeps running on the VM through a WS blip) and let a substitute fill the online gap; release only a client offline past `OFFLINE_TTL_S` (3600s); top up to N from the free-runner pool; trim over-N extras. Quotas that left the effective set release all their clients. Provenance: the engine only ever toggles the specific `sim_id` flag (+ `wsite`) it owns on a ledger client; a human manual pin on any other sim flag is never touched.

**multi_capable — exclusivity vs packing.** Failure sims (`dns_fail`, `dhcp_fail`, `assoc_fail`, `auth_fail`, `ssidpw_fail`, `port_flap`) are `multi_capable=False` → **exclusive: one failure sim per client** (the engine won't stack a second failure sim onto a client already running one, whether the existing one came from the engine, a manual pin, or the bucket default). Traffic sims (`ping_test`, `download`, `www_traffic`, `iperf`) are `multi_capable=True` → **they PACK**: a traffic quota may stack onto a client the engine already owns under another quota, and onto a client running an exclusive failure sim. So a single client can run `dns_fail` + `ping_test` + `download`, but never `dns_fail` + `assoc_fail`.

**Site resolution — why it's PXMX-server-based (per-site pool vs tenant pool).** A quota's `site` decides which clients are eligible. The engine resolves a client's effective site in priority order: a per-client `wsite` **override** → the **hosting PXMX server's assigned site** (`pxmx_site_map`, Config → PXMX Sites) → the bucket-default `wsite` → a `sim_config` fallback. The PXMX-server step is the load-bearing one, and it exists because of how the RF plant is wired:

> The sim systems live in **RF chambers** with **dedicated Proxmox nodes per site**. A "site" is a physical chamber, and the pxmx server is its boundary. With **site-based SSID** enabled, the SSID appends the site — site `MIA` with a `PSK` SSID becomes `MIA-PSK` — so each site's clients associate to a distinct SSID. With site-based SSID **disabled**, every site uses the same SSID (e.g. just `PSK`).

That is why the sim↔site linkage is **PXMX-server-based, not bucket-based**: linking the pxmx servers to a site (`pxmx_site_map`) makes each site its **own pool** of runners — the quota "10 DNS-fail in MIA" fills from the clients on MIA's nodes only, matching the RF chamber boundary. **Without** that linkage, every client resolves to its bucket-default `wsite` and you effectively get **one entire-tenant pool** (a quota with a blank site draws from anywhere). The key difference is **scale**: per-site pools bound a quota's blast radius and runner count to one chamber; a tenant-wide pool lets one quota consume runners across every chamber. Use per-site pools when chambers must be independent (separate RF isolation, separate SSIDs, separate client counts); use a tenant-wide pool when the plant is one logical fleet and you want maximum runner availability.

**Re-home (opt-in).** A per-quota `rehome` flag (default off) lets a site-specific quota borrow free runners from OTHER sites when its own pool can't fill the count — the engine sets `wsite` to re-home the borrowed client and the ledger records its original site (`from_site`) so a later release reverts it. Off by default so it doesn't defeat the per-site-pool isolation above; turn it on only when filling the count matters more than chamber isolation.

**Quota State view.** Config → Quota State shows the live ledger: which clients are currently assigned to each effective quota, the target count vs. assigned count, and `multi_capable`/`rehome` flags. (Manual-refresh under Config — form editors and the state view share the Config primary's no-auto-refresh.)

## How to use it

**Enable client simulation / auto-provisioning (the two toggles that both must be on).** Auto-provisioning has a *tenant* switch and a *per-agent* switch, and VMs only spawn when **both** are on:

1. Turn on the **tenant** switch: Simulations → **Setup → Proxmox** (or Config → Simulation), in the **"VM Auto-Provisioning"** card, set **"Auto-Provision VMs"** on (`usb_auto_provision`). While here also confirm the card's other knobs — VM template IDs, VMID range, CPU/mem thresholds, dongle VID:PIDs — since a missing template or empty dongle list also stops provisioning.
2. Turn on the **per-agent** switch for each Proxmox host: Setup → **Spokes & Agents** → the agent's row → **Edit** → check **"Enable Client Simulation mode on this host"** (`client_simulation.enabled`) and save. This is what actually puts the pxmx agent's provision loop into CS mode.
3. Watch **Simulations → VM Server**: each host row shows the `provision` diagnostic; when both flags are on and thresholds pass, the agent begins cloning sim VMs into the 90000+ VMID range.

**Run a demo scenario (auto-expiring fault).** Simulations → **Clients** tab → the target client's **Demo** column → pick a scenario (`normal` = clear, or one of `dns_fail` / `dhcp_fail` / `assoc_fail` / `auth_fail` / `ssidpw_fail` / `port_flap`) → trigger. It shows in the **"Active Demo Scenarios"** card with minutes remaining; it auto-clears after **120 minutes** (or on client reboot), reverting to the client's persisted state. Clear early from the same card / column.

**Toggle a per-client fault (persisted override).** Simulations → **Clients** → the client row's **⚙ Control** button opens **"Live Overrides — {hostname}"** with the 11 toggles: `kill_switch`, `dns_fail`, `iperf`, `download`, `www_traffic`, `ping_test`, `ssidpw_fail`, `auth_fail`, `dhcp_fail`, `port_flap`, `assoc_fail`. Set what you want → **Apply** (persists to that client), **Clear Overrides** (removes them), or **Apply to ALL** (pushes the same set to every registered client). Unlike a demo, these persist until you clear them. The client picks them up on its next `/api/config` fetch.

**Use the kill switch (emergency stop).** Simulations → **Clients** → the banner at the top: **"⛔ Emergency Stop"** halts all sims (clients poll `/api/kill-switch` and stand down); **"▶ Resume Sims"** re-enables. This is global; the per-client `kill_switch` override above stops just one client.

## Troubleshooting / common questions

**"Auto-provisioning is enabled but nothing provisions."** This is almost always the **two-flag trap**: the tenant-level **"Auto-Provision VMs"** toggle (`usb_auto_provision`) is a *different* switch from each host's **"Enable Client Simulation mode on this host"** (`client_simulation.enabled`). The pxmx agent's loop only spawns when **both** are on. Check the host's `provision` diagnostic on **VM Server** — it reports `cs_enabled`, `loop_running`, `auto_provision_on`, a `reason` string for the current gate, and `halt`. Common gate reasons beyond the two flags: no VM template configured, an empty dongle VID:PID list, CPU/mem over the 1h-average thresholds, or `provision_halt` set. Remember the brain runs in the agent; cs only relays and displays the diagnostic.

**"Sim clients aren't getting an IP."** Their addresses come from the **cs-owned Kea** (`kea-dhcp4-sim`) on the **second NIC** at `169.253.1.1`, subnet `169.253.1.0/24`, pool `169.253.1.11`–`.254` — not from the `dhcp` module. Check the hub-level **Setup → Simulations** DHCP-server card (or the telemetry `dhcp` block) for `installed`/`running`/utilization. On the box: `systemctl is-active kea-dhcp4-sim`, confirm the second NIC is up at `169.253.1.1`, and that the sim VMs are actually on the isolated network. Because the scope serves no router option, sim clients are intentionally isolated and reach only `169.253.1.1:8080`.

**"I changed a config/provisioning setting and nothing happened."** Hub-pushed provisioning config lands via the **`CS_CONFIG_UPDATE`** handler; without it, `usb_vidpids` stays `[]`, the bridge pulls an empty list every 60s, and auto-provision never fires. Also note the hub-config store **REPLACES** on write, so the two Setup cards ("VM Auto-Provisioning" and the flat "Hub Config") must GET-merge-PUT — if a save wiped the other card's values, re-open both and re-save. For simulation-profile edits, remember they only apply to a client on its next `/api/config` fetch, and per-`[username]` overrides key off the hostname's first `-` segment.

**"The simulation spoke is offline / red."** cs runs mainly as the **`simulation`** role on the agent (sub-spoke `{agent}-simulation`), dialing the hub on 443. If it's red: confirm the agent (`lm-agent`) is up and approved, that `install_cs.sh --infra-only` host prep ran (cs Kea + second NIC), and check the spoke logs. A spoke that never provisioned its Kea/NIC still connects but the DHCP card shows "Not configured."

**"Why is the client API on 8080 and not 8000?"** The legacy `webui-spoke` used :8000, but the unified LM hub owns that box, so binding :8000 collided and crash-looped cs. The client API moved to **8080**; sim clients reach `169.253.1.1:8080`. The installer auto-migrates a stale `CS_API_PORT=8000` in `.env` to 8080.
