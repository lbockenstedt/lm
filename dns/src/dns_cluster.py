"""Two-resolver DNS cluster: desired state, fan-out, convergence, reconcile.

One ``dns`` spoke (the **coordinator**) owns the authoritative record set and
drives N Unbound hosts (the **workers**). The coordinator — not any individual
resolver — is the source of truth:

* Every mutation (``DNS_SYNC`` / ``DNS_ADD`` / ``DNS_UPDATE`` / ``DNS_DELETE``)
  is applied to an in-memory desired state, **validated**, versioned, digested,
  persisted, and only then fanned out to every member.
* A member that fails or is offline does NOT downgrade the desired state. The
  fan-out reports ``PARTIAL`` (never ``SUCCESS``) and the reconcile pass drives
  the laggard forward once it is reachable again — which is also what converges
  a worker that reconnects after a reboot.
* Convergence is measured, not assumed: each worker reports the version + digest
  it actually has on disk, and :meth:`DnsClusterCoordinator.cluster_report`
  compares that against the desired digest to surface drift.

Records are validated against **directive injection** before they ever reach a
worker. Unbound config is line-oriented and quote-delimited
(``local-data: "name. ttl IN A 10.0.0.1"``), so an unvalidated value containing a
quote or newline could append arbitrary ``server:`` directives to the resolver's
config. :func:`validate_records` rejects those outright rather than escaping
them — a record that needs a quote or a newline is not a record.

Without 2+ configured members this module is inert: the spoke keeps its original
single-host local behavior.
